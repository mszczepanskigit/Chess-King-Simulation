# Chess-King-Simulation
The following little project shows a simulation of a random walk of a chess king on a 8x8 board.

The project was my test python script to check ChatGPT possibilities. It occured that firstly ChatGPT produced one serious (in my opinion) issue but in general code becomes more readable. Only final result of the project has been uploaded.
