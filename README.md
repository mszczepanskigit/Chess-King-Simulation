# Chess King Simulator

The next small project simulates a chess king's random movement across an 8x8 board.

My test Python script to investigate ChatGPT's potential served as the project.
A serious (in my opinion) problem with ChatGPT first appeared, but overall, the code became more readable.
The project's sole final output has been uploaded.

Another reason I created this project was to test my theoretical findings regarding the stationary distribution of the Markov Chain in such a random walk on an 8x8 board.
